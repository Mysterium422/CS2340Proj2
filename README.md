# Spotify Wrapped

## Description
Spotify wrapped is an easy way to view fascinating statistics about your Spotify listening habits. Even better, you can view your wrap at any time unlike Spotify where it can only be viewed at the end of the year. All you need to do is sign up and follow the instructions to link your Spotify account. Then click generate wrap and see what are your top artists, top songs, and more. The wrap automatically saves for you to look at later.
